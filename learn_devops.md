## Note Taking

_Taking notes is akin to managing a personal "knowledge base"._

Making a habit out of taking notes is one of the single greatest
force-multipliers for the IT professioal. Every exceptional developer, sysadmin,
engineer, etc that I've worked with was a note-taker. The methodologies used
doesn't seem to matter so much, but taking notes does.

* [The Zettlekasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)\
  _This is the method that I (mostly) use. See my [second brain](https://notes.kraker.dev/) as an example._
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)\
  Markdown note-taking tool. Supports Zettelkasten methodologies. This is what
  I'm currently using, although I've also used Vim, Emacs, and explored various
  other tools and text-editors in the past.
