# DevOps Learning Resources

**Author:** Alex Kraker [@kraker](https://github.com/kraker)\
**Updated:** 2025-08-31

This is a curated collection of the DevOps learning resources that I've found
to be the most useful or that my friends in the industry have recommended to me.
Those with a ✅ are what I consider to be _best in class_ for the topic they
cover and are most often my go-to recommendations.

# Getting Started

## Points of Entry

DevOps points of entry - not sure where to start? Start here:

- [roadmap.sh \| DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops)
- [Reddit \| Getting into DevOps](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/yjdscp/getting_into_devops/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

## DevOps Books

General books on DevOps as a whole. What exactly is DevOps anyways? Nobody is really sure, but these resources may elucidate.

* ✅ [The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/) by Gene Kim
* [The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Digital Disruption, Developers, and Overthrowing the Ancient Powerful Order](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-unicorn-project/) by Gene Kim
* [The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, & Security in Technology Organizations](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/) by Gene Kim, et al.

# Infrastructure

## Cloud Platforms

### AWS

### Azure

### GCP

## Virtualization

### VMware

### VirtualBox

My favorite _type 2_ hypervisor is VirtualBox (VB) for spinning up VMs with
[Vagrant](#vagrant). VB can be installed with the system package manager on many
Linux distributions, but these tend to be out of date. I recommend using the
official packages:

- [Linux\_Downloads – Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

### Proxmox VE

Debian-based, this is what I use in my homelab. I mostly have just used their
official [Proxmox VE Documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/) and the
community [Proxmox VE Wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page).

# Containerization & Orchestration

## Containerization

### Docker

- [Docker Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/) – Udemy

### Podman

_podman (pod manager)_\
Podman is basically Docker but it's FOSS, and has batteries included.

- [Podman](https://podman.io/)
  - [Getting Started with Podman \| Podman](https://podman.io/docs)
  - [Tutorials — Podman documentation](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Tutorials.html)
- [How does rootless Podman work? \| Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/how-does-rootless-podman-work)

## Container Orchestration

Beware, here be dragons. Container orchestration is not for the faint of heart.
These resources may help make the complexity demons manageable at least.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes (k8s) is the de facto standard for container orchestration. Developed
by the Trekkies at Google and born out something they called Borg. Resistance
is futile! You will be assimilated!

### Enterprise Linux

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

##### RHCSA Certification

Red Hat Certified System Administrator. The exam is 100% practical so it really
tests your hands-on knowledge. This is probably why it's such a trusted
industry _badge_.

###### Documentation & Tutorials

- [RHCSA Exam Objectives](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam) – Red Hat
- [Red Hat Certified System Administrator overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/s845x2/red_hat_certified_system_administrator_overview/) – Reddit
- [RHCSA study materials](https://www.reddit.com/r/redhat/comments/8arqd9/rhcsa_study_materials/) – Reddit
- [Best courses with hands-on labs for RHCSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/14zazsx/what_are_the_best_courses_with_hands_on_labs_to/) – Reddit

###### Books & Courses

- ✅ [RHCSA Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: Training and Exam Preparation Guide (EX200), Third Edition](https://www.amazon.com/RHCSA-Enterprise-Linux-Training-Preparation/dp/1803243074) by Asghar Ghori\
  _Good source. This source is more linux admin flavored, CLI-centric which I think more accurately reflects sysadmin day-to-day. The user is encouraged to "learn-by-doing" while following along... this is a solid approach to building muscle memory for the CLI I've found._

- [Red Hat RHCSA 9 Cert Guide EX200](https://www.ciscopress.com/store/red-hat-rhcsa-9-cert-guide-ex200-9780138096335) by Sander van Vugt\
  _Good source. Sander Van Vugt's courses are considered the de facto standard for prep, but I'm not sure if the book is as good as the courses... this source does seem to have better practical tips. For example, recommending using `dnf provides` to find what package needs to be installed to provide a command, and what man pages to refer to rather than memorizing complex or arcane syntax, such as `semanage fcontext -a -t ...`. Some topics are not as complete and the coverage focuses on just what's needed for the exam._

###### Videos & Interactive

- [RHCSA RHEL 9 Complete Video Course](https://www.pearsonitcertification.com/store/red-hat-rhcsa-rhel-9-complete-video-course-9780138097714) by Sander van Vugt\
  _I didn't buy the course since I tend to prefer books over video lecture style courses. But this is considered by many to be the de facto standard when it comes to studying for the RHCSA exams. The book above comes with a pretty significant discount, so I recommend buying the book for the coupon._

- [RHCSA Guru](https://www.rhcsaguru.com/)\
  _I haven't tried this yet, but hands-on labs may be worth the price of admission..._

##### RHCE Certification

Red Hat Certified Engineer - focuses on Ansible automation (90% Ansible-based since RHEL 8).

###### Documentation & Tutorials

_Resources coming soon_

###### Books & Courses

- [Red Hat RHCE 8 (EX294) Cert Guide](https://www.ciscopress.com/store/red-hat-rhce-8-ex294-cert-guide-9780135656495) by Sander van Vugt\
  _A bit outdated. Refers to Ansible Tower instead of AAP. Based on RHEL 8 but current exam is RHEL 9. Sander van Vugt's courses and books are still considered the de facto standard for preparing for both RHCSA and RHCE._

- [Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) Ansible Automation Study Guide](https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/red-hat-certified-engineer-rhce-ansible-automation-study-guide) – Red Hat Developer\
  _Free with developer subscription. A good overview of the objectives, but it's breadth vs depth. Probably best as a supplementary study source. Seems like Red Hat is trying to sell you courses, AAP, etc. by giving away this ebook for free._

- ✅ [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) by Jeff Geerling\
  _Still one of the best sources out there on learning Ansible IMO. But not directed at RHCE specifically._

## Note Taking

_Taking notes is akin to managing a personal "knowledge base"._

Making a habit out of taking notes is one of the single greatest force-multipliers for the IT professional. Every exceptional developer, sysadmin, engineer, etc that I've worked with was a note-taker. The methodologies used don't seem to matter so much, but taking notes does.

- [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes) by Sönke Ahrens
- [The Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)\
  _This is the method that I (mostly) use. See my [second brain](https://notes.kraker.dev/) as an example._
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)\
  Markdown note-taking tool. Supports Zettelkasten methodologies. This is what
  I'm currently using, although I've also used Vim, Emacs, and explored various
  other tools and text-editors in the past.
