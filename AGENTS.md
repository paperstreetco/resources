## Repository Overview

This is a documentation repository containing IT skills and career development resources. It contains curated learning materials for DevOps, career development, and professional growth.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Main index with navigation to all resource categories
- `career_dev.md` - Career development resources including books, resume writing, salary negotiation, and recruiting guidance
- `learn_devops.md` - Comprehensive DevOps learning resources covering cloud platforms, containerization, automation, networking, and systems administration

## Content Organization

The repository uses a structured approach to resource curation:
- Resources marked with ✅ are considered "best in class" recommendations
- Content is organized by topic with clear hierarchical sections
- Each resource includes relevant context and author recommendations
- External links point to books, courses, tutorials, and documentation

## Working with this Repository

This is primarily a documentation repository with no build processes, tests, or development workflows. When making changes:

- Follow the existing markdown structure and formatting conventions
- Maintain the hierarchical organization of topics
- Preserve the ✅ marking system for top recommendations
- Include relevant context for new resource additions
- Update the README.md index when adding new major sections

## Markdown Style Preferences

When editing markdown files in this repository, follow these formatting conventions:

- Use **double asterisks** for bold text (not underscores)
- Use _single underscores_ for italicized text (not asterisks)
- Use dashes (-) for unordered lists consistently throughout
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (H1 for major sections, H2/H3/H4 for subsections)
- Include descriptive text for sections to provide context
- Use "_Resources coming soon_" in italics for placeholder sections

## Contributions Welcome

PRs are welcome! Many sections show "_Resources coming soon_" and would benefit from quality resource additions.

## Key Features

- **learn_devops.md** contains extensive DevOps learning paths covering cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), automation (CI/CD, Ansible, Terraform), and systems administration
- **career_dev.md** focuses on professional development with book recommendations, resume writing services, and career planning resources
