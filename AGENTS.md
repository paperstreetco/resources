## Repository Overview

This is a documentation repository containing IT skills and career development resources. It contains curated learning materials for DevOps, career development, and professional growth.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Main index with navigation to all resource categories
- `career_dev.md` - Career development resources including books, resume writing, salary negotiation, and recruiting guidance
- `learn_devops.md` - Comprehensive DevOps learning resources covering cloud platforms, containerization, automation, networking, and systems administration

## Content Organization

The repository uses a structured approach to resource curation:
- Resources marked with ✅ are considered "best in class" recommendations
- Content is organized by topic with clear hierarchical sections
- Each resource includes relevant context and author recommendations
- External links point to books, courses, tutorials, and documentation

## Working with this Repository

This is primarily a documentation repository with no build processes, tests, or development workflows. When making changes:

- Follow the existing markdown structure and formatting conventions
- Maintain the hierarchical organization of topics
- Preserve the ✅ marking system for top recommendations
- Include relevant context for new resource additions
- Update the README.md index when adding new major sections

## Markdown Style Preferences

When editing markdown files in this repository, follow these formatting conventions:

- Use **double asterisks** for bold text (not underscores)
- Use _single underscores_ for italicized text (not asterisks)
- Use dashes (-) for unordered lists consistently throughout
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (H1 for major sections, H2/H3/H4 for subsections)
- Include descriptive text for sections to provide context
- Use "_Resources coming soon_" in italics for placeholder sections

## Resource Structure Conventions

When adding resources to any topic, use the following standardized subsection structure:

### Standard Resource Categories (in this order):
1. **Documentation & Tutorials** - Official docs, tutorials, guides, community discussions
2. **Books & Courses** - Books, formal courses, certification materials
3. **Videos & Interactive** - Video content, interactive platforms, hands-on labs

### Implementation Examples:
```markdown
### Topic Name
#### Documentation & Tutorials
- [Official Documentation](url) – Source
- [Tutorial Name](url) – Source
- [Community Discussion](url) – Reddit

#### Books & Courses  
- [Book Title](url) by Author Name
- [Course Name](url) – Platform

#### Videos & Interactive
- [Video Series](url) – YouTube
- [Interactive Platform](url) – Platform
```

### Usage Guidelines:
- Always maintain this order: Documentation → Books → Videos
- Include author names for books: "by Author Name"
- Include platform/source for courses and videos: "– Platform"
- Use em-dashes (–) for source identification
- Add personal commentary in italics after resources when valuable
- Use "_Resources coming soon_" for empty categories

## Contributions Welcome

PRs are welcome! Many sections show "_Resources coming soon_" and would benefit from quality resource additions.
